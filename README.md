# java_practice
***

This is a cute lil repo for those in QA that actually want to imrove and get good at java. There are execises for beginner to more intermediate level. 

`/files` is a folder for each of the java files. Especially in the beginning when you have no idea what you're doing, they will help you and give some pointers on what to do, or give an outline on the function you're wokring on.

`/subjects` is a folder for all instructions for each of the execises. Follow the list below to in which order you complete the exercises:
- [ ] dev-setup.md
- [ ] github.md
- [ ] java-1.md
- [ ] java-2.md
- [ ] java-3.md
There are more topics comming soon... (give me a bit okay D:)

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to edit the file in the future and push your changes into your own github, then it is highly suggested to follow (the github execises)[subjects/github.md] instead of following the 3 steps in "Getting started".

<details>
<summary>Getting started</summary>

### step 1. 
Open Terminal. Google how to do that on your device.

### step 2. 
Navigate to the correct location or folder within the terminal, to where you want the java_practice folder to be at. Refer to "How to use terminal?" guide below for more information on how to do this. If unsure where it should be, then Desktop is alwasy a good choice.

### step 3. 
Run the following two commands in terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/em1e/java_practice.git
cd java_practice
```

Now the repository/folder should be downloaded, and you can start working on the execises. Below you can find some helpful guides on how to do things code related, if you have any questions, then dm me (mie) on discord.

GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. While Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files.

<summary>How to use terminal?</summary>

## What is terminal?
A terminal is simply a text-based interface to the computer. In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents. **Below you can find a table for the most common commands and what they do:**

| Command | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| pwd	| Print the path of the current directory |    |
| mkdir FOLDERPATH	| Create a new directory | `mkdir new_folder` |
| cd FOLDERPATH	| Change or go into a directory | `cd new_folder` |
| cd ..	| Change or go into the parent directory | `mkdir ../another_folder` |
| clear	| Clear the terminal window |    |
| ls	| List the contents of a folder |    |
| ls -al	| List all the contents of a folder with info |    |
| cat TARGET	| Show the content of TARGET | `cat ../new_folder/instructions.txt` |
| cp SOURCE TARGET	| Copy SOURCE to TARGET | `cp new_folder/instructions.txt another_folder/.` |
| rm TARGET	| remove TARGET | `rm new_folder/instructions.txt` |

If you wish to practice terminal commands, then start with exercises in `subjects/terminal.md` and `subjects/github.md`. Remember that google is your best friend, if unsure then ask anotehr QA member.

<summary>What if I don't know java?</summary>

For you to do these exercises try to get familiar with the syntax first, or refer back to any of the free resources online. There are ones like (w3schools)[https://www.w3schools.com/java/], (execism)[https://exercism.org/tracks/java], (codeacademy)[https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java], (javatpoint)[https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial], and so many more you could use.

Ofc ask for help if you need it, but google is also a friend that knows a lot.
