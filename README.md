# java_practice
***

This is a cute lil repo for those in QA that actually want to improve and get good at java. There are execises for beginner to more intermediate level. 

`/files` is a folder for each of the java files. Especially in the beginning when you have no idea what you're doing, they will help you and give some pointers on what to do, or give an outline on the function you're wokring on.

`/subjects` is a folder for all instructions for each of the execises. Follow the list below to in which order you complete the exercises:
- [ ] dev-setup.md
- [X] github.md
- [X] java-1.md (not fully done)
- [ ] java-2.md
- [ ] java-3.md
There are more topics comming soon... (give me a bit okay D:)

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to edit the file and push the changes into your own github, then it is highly suggested to follow [the github execises](https://github.com/em1e/java_practice/blob/main/subjects/github.md) instead of the steps below.

## Getting started

### step 1. Open Terminal. 
Google how to do that on your device.

### step 2. Navigate inside your terminal to where you want to java_practice folder to be at.
Refer to "How to use terminal?" guide below for more information on how to do this. If unsure where it should be, then Desktop is alwasy a good choice. This can be compleated using `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`.

### step 3. Clone the repository
Run the following two commands in terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/em1e/java_practice.git
cd java_practice
```

### DONE!
Woo!! Now the repository/folder should be downloaded, and you can start working on the execises. Below you can find some helpful guides on how to do things code related, if you have any questions then dm me (mie) on discord.

<summary>How to use terminal?</summary>

## What is terminal?
A terminal is simply a text-based interface to the computer. In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents. **Below you can find a table for the most common commands and what they do:**

| Command | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| pwd	| Print the path of the current directory |    |
| mkdir FOLDERPATH	| Create a new directory | `mkdir new_folder` |
| cd FOLDERPATH	| Change or go into a directory | `cd new_folder` |
| cd ..	| Change or go into the parent directory | `mkdir ../another_folder` |
| clear	| Clear the terminal window |    |
| ls	| List the contents of a folder |    |
| ls -al	| List all the contents of a folder with info |    |
| cat TARGET	| Show the content of TARGET | `cat ../new_folder/instructions.txt` |
| cp SOURCE TARGET	| Copy SOURCE to TARGET | `cp new_folder/instructions.txt another_folder/.` |
| rm TARGET	| remove TARGET | `rm new_folder/instructions.txt` |

If you wish to practice terminal commands, then start with exercises in [`subjects/dev-setup.md`](https://github.com/em1e/java_practice/blob/main/subjects/dev-setup.md) and [`subjects/github.md`](https://github.com/em1e/java_practice/blob/main/subjects/github.md). Remember that google is your best friend, if unsure then ask anotehr QA member.

<summary>What if I don't know java? or any coding?</summary>

## Unsure if you're good enough to start coding in java?

There really isn't any requirements to learning how to code. It's just a bit of problem solving and logical thinking.

Before you start the java exorcises it would be good to be familiar with the syntax first, or to refer back to any of the free resources online while working on them. There are ones like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/), [execism](https://exercism.org/tracks/java), [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java), [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial), and so many more you could use.
