## What if I don't know java or any coding? Am bad at math?

There really isn't any requirements to learning how to code. It's just a bit of problem solving and logical thinking. If you know how simple addition and logically speakig how to divide and multiply things then you're set.

Before you start the java exorcises below it would be good to be familiar with the syntax first, or to refer back to any of the free resources online while working on them. There are ones like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/), [execism](https://exercism.org/tracks/java), [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java), [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial), and many more you could use.

We suggest compelating the exercises that [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) offers first, and then either straight moving into the ones over here or working ones fround from [execism](https://exercism.org/tracks/java).

You can find the java file with the outlines at `../files/java-1.java`, so head over there to get started.
